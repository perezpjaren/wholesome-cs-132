						<h4>Motivation</h4>
                        <p>
							Despite what non-believers may say – <strong>climate change IS real</strong> – and its rampant effects continue to affect the entire globe
							in the present. The worsening climate has only caused people to question the effectiveness of current climate efforts in reducing
							emissions. Given that the world’s population has only ever increased in number, this implies that more and more people should be able to
							contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions – but that’s not exactly the case. So, how exactly does population correlate to
							CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? The team will look at data from the Philippines and its neighboring countries to find out.

						<h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>
							Over the past five decades, the Philippines has witnessed a significant rise in its population, sparking major concerns about its
							environmental impact, specifically its <strong>carbon footprint</strong>. Hence, understanding the relationship between population growth
							and carbon emissions has become essential for devising effective sustainable development strategies. Furthermore, comparing the Philippines'
							carbon footprint to that of neighboring countries can provide valuable insights into the drivers of national emissions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two essential studies serve as the foundation for this research. The first study uses advanced time series data mining techniques to
							estimate carbon footprint emissions in the Philippines. Using data from 1990 to 2019, the study finds a strong association between
							population growth, energy production, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Notably, it emphasizes the importance of population dynamics as a major
							source of carbon emissions.<sup>[1]</sup>
						</p>
						<p>
							The second study expands the scope to include five ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, and looks at the relationship between
							economic development, industrial value added, population, and carbon emissions. Panel regression study finds a positive relationship
							between economic and population growth and carbon emissions, with industrial value added having little impact.<sup>[2]</sup>
						</p>
						<p>
							To deepen our understanding, we intend to broaden both the spatial and temporal scope in our research. We can obtain deeper insights into
							the dynamics of population growth and its implications for carbon emissions by incorporating data from a broader range of sites outside of
							the ASEAN region and extending the time period to include more decades. This larger perspective will help to build more complete and nuanced
							methods for addressing environmental concerns.

						<h2>Collection</h2>
						<p>
							Data was gathered through <strong>desk research on government websites, international organization reports, and reputable
							academic databases</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							For <strong>population data</strong>, the group’s main source of information is
							<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/" target="_blank">World Bank</a>, while supporting sources are
							<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" target="_blank">Worldometer</a> and
							<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/" target="_blank">MacroTrends</a>. Population data first gathered from the
							World Bank website was subjected to cross-checking with the latter two websites. Any missing and inconsistent data from the World Bank
							website was added and replaced, respectively, in the data set for consistency and accuracy. Rest assured that the data from
							Worldometer and MacroTrends are credible as their source is the 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. This is the
							twenty-seventh edition of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, which also includes data for selected dates
							from the 1950s and onwards.
						</p>
						<p>
							For <strong>carbon emission data</strong>, all information was originally gathered from
							<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a> whose source is the Global Carbon Budget 2022
							paper which can be accessed in <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4811/2022/#section5" target="_blank">ESSD Copernicus</a>.
							However, the group soon realized that around 20 years of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data for Timor-Leste was missing. Thus, more data was collected
							from the <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023" target="_blank"> Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)</a>.
							Their 2023 report includes a more complete list of fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emission data from 1970 to 2022 (most updated data so far), and so
							the team decided to use their data instead.

						</div>
						<div class="post-info">
							<h4>How has the population growth in the Philippines over the past fifty years impacted its carbon footprint?</h4>
							<p>
								From the line plot shown, it can be seen that there is a straight and linear increase in the Philippine population from 1974 to 2022.
								And despite CO<sub>2</sub> emissions having increased substantially in the same amount of time, it does not rise as straightforwardly.
								Instead, emission data shows clear dips and steep rises between years, indicating that <strong>several factors other than consistent
								population increase may have contributed to its varying growth</strong>.

							<h4>How significant is the disparity between the carbon emissions in the Philippines and other nearby countries?</h4>
							<p>
								The bar plot describes the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of countries within the scope of our research for the past 50 years. From
								first glance alone, it is clear that China is a noticeable outlier in our data, with about 3 times as much emissions as its next best
								contender, Japan. Compared to the Philippines, the aforementioned countries have significantly greater carbon emissions. A more
								general view of the plot, however, shows <strong>notably smaller disparities between the Philippines and the other 18 countries</strong>.

						<h4 align="center">Hypothesis Testing</h4>
                        <p>
							To assess which of the hypotheses to accept and reject, the team decided to use <strong>Spearman’s Rank Correlation</strong> on the dataset.
							To note, this method assumes that the samples are uncorrelated, corresponding to the null hypothesis. As the data includes samples from 21
							countries including the Philippines, the team decided to apply Spearman’s rank correlation to each country accordingly. This way, the team
							gets an overview of the dependency of carbon emissions and population data for each country, and identify a general consensus and possible
							outliers.
						</p>
						
						<br />

						<p>
							From testing, the team got an almost unanimous result of p-values close to zero. This implies that the samples being uncorrelated is very
							unlikely, and since the majority of the correlation coefficient is close to 1, it can be said that there is a <strong>strong positive or
							direct correlation between population and carbon emissions</strong>. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative.
						</p>

						<br />

						<p>
							Note that all but one country actually showed a p-value close to 0.5, which is <strong>Palau</strong>. The probable statistical independence
							between the country’s carbon emissions and population data could probably be attributed to the fact that Palau has in fact the lowest
							population statistic in the data set. Perhaps that data characteristic also somehow implies that there are more significant factors other
							than population that can affect carbon emissions for countries whose population are on the lower side of the spectrum.
