                        <p>
							Despite what non-believers may make you think – <strong>climate change IS real</strong> – and its rampant effects continue to affect the
							entire globe in the present. The worsening climate has only caused us to question the effectiveness of our climate efforts in reducing
							emissions. Given that the world’s population has only ever increased in number, this implies that more and more people should be able to
							contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions – but that’s not exactly the case. So, how exactly does population correlate to
							CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? We look at data from the Philippines and its neighboring countries to find out.

						<h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>
							Over the past five decades, the Philippines has witnessed a significant rise in its population, sparking major concerns about its
							environmental impact, specifically its <strong>carbon footprint</strong>. Hence, understanding the relationship between population growth
							and carbon emissions has become essential for devising effective sustainable development strategies. Furthermore, comparing the Philippines'
							carbon footprint to that of neighboring countries can provide valuable insights into the drivers of national emissions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two essential studies serve as the foundation for this research. The first study uses advanced time series data mining techniques to
							estimate carbon footprint emissions in the Philippines. Using data from 1990 to 2019, the study finds a strong association between
							population growth, energy production, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Notably, it emphasizes the importance of population dynamics as a major
							source of carbon emissions.<sup>[1]</sup>
						</p>
						<p>
							The second study expands the scope to include five ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, and looks at the relationship between
							economic development, industrial value added, population, and carbon emissions. Panel regression study finds a positive relationship
							between economic and population growth and carbon emissions, with industrial value added having little impact.<sup>[2]</sup>
						</p>
						<p>
							To deepen our understanding, we intend to broaden both the spatial and temporal scope in our research. We can obtain deeper insights into
							the dynamics of population growth and its implications for carbon emissions by incorporating data from a broader range of sites outside of
							the ASEAN region and extending the time period to include more decades. This larger perspective will help to build more complete and nuanced
							methods for addressing environmental concerns.

						<p>
							Data was gathered through <strong>desk research on government websites, international organization reports, and reputable

						</p>
						<p>
							For <strong>population data</strong>, the team’s main source of information is
							<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/" target="_blank">World Bank</a>, while the supporting
							sources are <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" target="_blank">Worldometer</a> and
							<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/" target="_blank">MacroTrends</a>. Population data first gathered from the
							World Bank website was subjected to cross-checking with the latter two websites. Any missing and inconsistent data from the World Bank
							website was added and replaced, respectively, in the data set for consistency and accuracy. Rest assured that the data from
							Worldometer and MacroTrends are credible as their source is the 2022 Revision of World Population Prospects. This is the
							twenty-seventh edition of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, which also includes data for selected dates
							from the 1950s and onwards.
						</p>
						<p>
							For <strong>carbon emission data</strong>, all information was originally gathered from
							<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a> whose source is the Global Carbon Budget 2022
							paper which can be accessed in <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4811/2022/#section5" target="_blank">ESSD Copernicus</a>.
							However, we soon realized that around 20 years of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data for Timor-Leste was missing. Thus, more data was
							collected from the <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023" target="_blank"> Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
							(EDGAR)</a>. Their 2023 report includes a more complete list of fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emission data from 1970 to 2022 (most updated data
							so far), and so we decided to use their data instead.

							<h4>How has the population growth in the Philippines over the past fifty years impacted its carbon footprint?</h4>
							<p>
								From the line plot shown, it can be seen that there is a straight and linear increase in the Philippine population from 1974 to 2022.
								And despite CO<sub>2</sub> emissions having increased substantially in the same amount of time, it does not rise as straightforwardly.
								Instead, emission data shows clear dips and steep rises between years, indicating that <strong>several factors other than consistent
								population increase may have contributed to its varying growth</strong>.

								The bar plot describes the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of countries within the scope of the research for the past 50 years. It is

								Philippines, these countries have significantly greater carbon emissions. A more general view of the plot, however, shows
								<strong>notably smaller disparities between the Philippines and the other 18 countries</strong>.

						<h4>Hypothesis Testing</h4>
                        <p>
							To assess which of the hypotheses to accept and reject, the team decided to use <strong>Spearman’s Rank Correlation</strong> on the dataset.
							To note, this method assumes that the samples are uncorrelated, corresponding to the null hypothesis. As the data includes samples from 21
							countries including the Philippines, we decided to apply Spearman’s rank correlation to each country accordingly. This way, we get an
							overview of the dependency of carbon emissions and population data for each country, and identify a general consensus and possible outliers.
						</p>
						
						<br />

						<p>
							From testing, we got an almost unanimous result of p-values close to zero. This implies that the samples being uncorrelated is very
							unlikely, and since the majority of the correlation coefficient is close to 1, it can be said that there is a <strong>strong positive or
							direct correlation between population and carbon emissions</strong>. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative.
						</p>

						<br />

						<p>
							Note that all but one country actually showed a p-value close to 0.5, which is <strong>Palau</strong>. The probable statistical independence
							between the country’s carbon emissions and population data could probably be attributed to the fact that Palau has in fact the lowest
							population statistic in the data set. Perhaps that data characteristic also somehow implies that there are more significant factors other
							than population that can affect carbon emissions for countries whose population are on the lower side of the spectrum.

									Rejecting our null hypothesis in favor of the alternative reveals an answer to our first research question. The <strong>direct or
									positive correlation</strong> between population and carbon emission implies that as population growth in the Philippines increased, its
									carbon footprint increased as well. However, it is important to note that population is <strong>not the be-all and end-all cause</strong>
									of the country’s emissions. Other factors likely affected it, considering that our visualization still showed dips in total emissions
									despite a continuous increase in population data.

									There is <strong>little disparity between the carbon emissions of the Philippines and the majority of the countries</strong> included in
									this project. However, this generalization <strong>does not apply to Japan, and most definitely not China</strong>. While Japan has
									considerable amounts of emissions totalling at around 56 billion tons, it certainly does not come close to China whose total comes up to
									260 billion tons. Compared to these outliers, the Philippines’ emission data for the past 50 years only amounts to 3.50 billion tons,
									which is undeniably only a fraction of the recorded emissions from China.

						<h4>Implications</h4>
                        <p>
							These results have significant implications as we can clearly see where the main issues lie.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, by confirming that population growth can influence and contribute to carbon emissions, we can isolate which countries have denser
							populations and urge them to <strong>be more proactive in taking climate action</strong>. Policies that address CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
							should be more strictly implemented in significantly populated areas, as they have the most potential to either worsen or improve their
							carbon emission output. Authorities could also formulate better laws and policies to address the issue based on the findings from this
							project. That being said, despite the Philippines not being a top contributor to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, our governmental authorities
							should still take action as our climate action programs and policies are nearly imperceivable.
						</p>
						<p>
							Second, having established that population is only part of the total contributors to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, this project opens up
							<strong>further areas of research concerning other factors</strong> that could affect emission data. This is also a crucial endeavor as
							carbon emission is one of the most prevalent causes of global warming, and identifying other and more reducible factors that contribute
							to its unwanted growth could be more beneficial than trying to control population growth itself.

						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>
							This project aimed to see how the population growth in the Philippines has impacted its carbon footprint. And indeed, we found out that
							the country’s population and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions rose together throughout the last 50 years. We were also able to grasp the disparity
							of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the ones of other nearby countries. Ultimately, we were able to achieve the main objectives of this
							project.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, we strongly believe that <strong>this endeavor doesn’t stop here</strong>. As the issue of rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
							becomes more relevant than ever, we implore the following sectors of society to take action.

								The results of this study emphasize the need for stronger foundations, not only for climate change policies, but also for sustainable
								development strategies, public awareness initiatives, and effective population management. The government must prioritize
								<strong>robust action plans</strong> that address these points.

							<h4>Researchers</h4>
							<p>
								Building on this study, future researchers should further investigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions considering <strong>various factors
								besides population growth</strong>, such as economic and industrial activities. Although the correlation discovered shows promise,
								it is without a doubt that this issue goes way beyond this one facet.

								And finally, we urge every single Filipino to constantly educate themselves on the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, actively adopt

								steps</strong>, we can safeguard a more secure future for our country.
